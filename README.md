# Introduction 
❖ Employee attrition is a significant challenge for organizations, especially those like XYZ, which employs a substantial workforce of approximately 4,000 individuals. With an annual attrition rate of 15%, XYZ faces various operational and strategic difficulties, including delayed projects, increased recruitment costs, and the need to train and integrate new hires. These challenges not only impact the company's financial performance but also its reputation among clients and partners.

❖ To address this issue effectively, XYZ's management has partnered with an HR analytics firm to identify the factors driving employee attrition and determine actionable steps to reduce it. By modeling the probability of attrition and analyzing its key drivers, the company aims to make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention

# Objective 

❖ Understand the Factors Contributing to Attrition: Identify key variables influencing employees’ decisions to leave the organization, including workplace conditions, managerial practices, and personal circumstances.

❖Prioritize Interventions: Determine the most significant factors driving attrition, enabling the company to focus on high-impact areas for immediate action.

❖Recommend Solutions: Provide actionable insights and strategies to enhance employee satisfaction, engagement, and loyalty, thereby reducing attrition rates.

❖ This analysis will not only help XYZ optimize its workforce management but also enhance its competitive edge by creating a stable and motivated workforce. The insights gained from this study can guide long-term strategies for employee retention and organizational growth.

# Problem Statement 

A large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons -

The former employees’ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners

A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent
More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company
Hence, the management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.

Since you are one of the star analysts at the firm, this project has been given to you.
